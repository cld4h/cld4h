### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

[ç®€ä¸­](README.zh.md)

I'm a [LARBS](https://larbs.xyz/) user, an audience of [Luke Smith](https://lukesmith.xyz).

I'm also an audience of [å¥½å’Œçµƒ](http://wiwikuan.com/about/).

I hate smoking, but I'm ok to be friend with a smoker, as long as you:
* Don't smoke indoor
* Don't smoke in public
* Don't smoke while walking
* Don't let me see you smoking.
