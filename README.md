### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

[ç®€ä¸­](README.zh.md)

I'm a [LARBS](https://larbs.xyz/) user, an audience of [Luke Smith](https://lukesmith.xyz).

I'm also an audience of [NiceChord å¥½å’Œå¼¦](https://nicechord.com/).

I hate smoking, but I'm ok to be friend with a smoker, as long as you:
* Don't smoke indoor
* Don't smoke in public
* Don't smoke while walking
* Don't let me see you smoking.

My lifelong dream: get away from "the system" and become self-sufficient.

Short term moves:
1. Move to a free country (most likely Canada or the US).
2. Earn some money.
3. Gain all kinds of living skills.
4. Get a piece of land.
5. Be aware not indulging too much in "the system" at step 2 & 3.
6. If I'm still single at step 2, living in a "truck house" would be great, so that I can keep my expanse low and save up money for the land. 
   The mobility is also a bonus.
